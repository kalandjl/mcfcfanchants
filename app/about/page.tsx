                {`     As a Man City fan, I noticed that on the internet there weren't 
                any dedicated chant websites for the club where you could search 
                and find chants based of the player, subject, or theme. Along 
                with this, it had been a while since I put my programming skills to
                use and had never created an project that was publicly avaliable.
                So I decided to create MCFC Fan Chants as a way of combining my 
                love of football with my love of coding, and also a reliable source
                that Citizens anywhere could use if they wanted to learn new chants,
                find lyrics, or just listen to the classics. I've spent a lot of time 
                to deliver this project, fully made by myself, and I hope that everyone
                can get something out of the website as it was intended to do so. 
                I'd also like to thank anyone reading this for checking the website 
                out, it means a lot to me and if you have any questions, suggestions
                or comments you can find me on the contact page.`}
